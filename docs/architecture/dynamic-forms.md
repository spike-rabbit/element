# Dynamic forms
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 MD046 -->

Element supports dynamic forms using [Angular Formly](https://formly.dev/)
which allows to generate forms from JSON data.

## Code ---

### Usage

??? info "Required Packages"
    - [@ngx-formly/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngx-formly/core)
    - [@ngx-formly/bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngx-formly/bootstrap)

```ts
import { SiFormlyModule } from '@spike-rabbit/element-ng/formly';

@NgModule({
  imports: [SiFormlyModule, ...]
})
```

### Standalone support

Formly does not provide standalone support yet [see also](https://formly.dev/docs/guide/faq#formly-standalone-components-support).

However, starting from Element v46.5.0 you can use the workaround
provided in [comment](https://github.com/ngx-formly/ngx-formly/issues/3721#issuecomment-1602401526).

Include `SiFormlyModule` in your app configuration to register your custom types/validators/wrappers.

```ts
import { ApplicationConfig, importProvidersFrom } from '@angular/core';
import { SiFormlyModule } from '@spike-rabbit/element-ng/formly';

const config: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    importProvidersFrom(
      SiFormlyModule.forRoot({
        // optionally you can add following configurations
        types: [
          // register your custom types here
        ],
        validators: [
          // register your custom validators here
        ],
        wrappers: [
          // register your custom wrapper here
        ]
      })
    )
  ]
}
```

### SiFormlyComponent

The `SiFormlyComponent` is a wrapper around formly to generate dynamic forms.
Please note that if you don't use this wrapper your form items will not be themed correctly based on Element theme and you might have to manually manage theming which is not recommended.

## Utilities

There are plenty of utilities custom-made for you to develop apps with dynamic forms using `SiFormly`.

### [Custom Types](https://formly.dev/docs/guide/custom-formly-field)

  In addition to prebuilt types from bootstrap, Element also provides you with a set of custom types that help you to easily make use of Element components in formly.

        - `iconSize`
            - the size of the icon to be displayed in pixels.
        - `iconTooltip`
            - Tooltip for the icon to be displayed.

### Grid layout

`SiFormly` also supports rendering form with multi column grid layout.

<si-docs-component example="si-formly/si-dynamic-form-grid" height="350"></si-docs-component>

### Tabs

`SiFormly` also supports rendering form in multiple tabs. It uses `SiTabsetComponent` internally for displaying tabs.

<si-docs-component example="si-formly/si-dynamic-form-tabs" height="350"></si-docs-component>

### Accordion

`SiFormly` also supports rendering forms in accordions. It makes use of `SiAccordionComponent` internally.

<si-docs-component example="si-formly/si-dynamic-form-accordion" height="350"></si-docs-component>

### i18n support

`SiFormly` internally uses a [custom extension](https://formly.dev/docs/guide/custom-formly-extension) `translate` to internationalize your forms.  
It is configured similar to [this doc on formly](https://formly.dev/docs/examples/advanced/i18n-alternative) but without the hard dependency to `ngx-translate` library.
