Each step contains a `description` and a `state`. Optionally a step can have a
`value` as well as an `error message`. Each step can also define a `custom icon`
to be displayed.

This component requires an array of `ResultDetailStep` objects as
an input. The possible states are defined in the enum
`ResultDetailStepState`. More information can be found below.
