# Bar chart

Shows the differences or similarities between values. Bar chart data answers the
question of "*how many?*" in each category.

## Usage ---

Use it to perform a comparison of values across different subgroups of data.
From a bar chart, it can be seen which groups are highest or most common, and
how groups compare against each other.

### Basic variant

The basic bar chart shows numerical comparisons across categories. One axis of
the chart shows the specific categories being compared and the other axis is
numeric in nature.

### Multi-set variant

This variation is used when two or more data series are plotted side-by-side and
grouped together under categories, all on the same axis.

### Stacked variant

The stacked bar chart is used to show how a category is divided. It helps to
understand what relationship each part has with the total amount.

### Best practices

- Plot the bars against a zero-value baseline to accurately reflect the
  difference in the data.
- Use colors with purpose. Select accent colors to highlight meaningful changes.
- Bar charts can be vertical or horizontal. Horizontal bar charts work best when
  there are lots of different categories with long labels.
- Use common sense and adjust the width of the bars according to the amount of
  elements. The minimum bar width is `16px`.
