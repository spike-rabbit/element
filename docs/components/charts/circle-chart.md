# Circle chart

The **circle chart**, displayed as a pie or donut chart, shows how much each part of
something makes up the whole. Each arc length represents a proportion of each
category, while the full circle represents the total sum of all the data, equal
to 100%.

## Usage ---

In order to use a donut or pie chart, there must be a whole amount that is
divided into a number of distinct parts. The primary goal is to compare each
part contribution to the whole, as opposed to comparing parts to each other.

### Basic donut chart

A donut chart uses arc segments to display individual dimensions. When compared
to pie charts, they are visually lighter and easier to read.

### Donut chart with center label

If needed, the space in the middle can be used to display data.

### Pie chart

Pie charts are visually heavy, be mindful about the size and colors selected to
display the data.

### Best practices

- Use pie charts sparingly.
- Don't plot more than five categories on the same circle chart. If needed,
  consider merging small slices into a single *other* slice.
- Don't use multiple circle charts to make comparisons between them.
- Consider the order of the categories, audiences will likely read the chart
  clockwise.
- Consider placing the chart values as part of the legend, especially when
  dealing with long numbers.
- The legend can be placed below or right to the circle chart. Use good
  judgement to select the best layout according to current need.
