# Element Code Review Style Guide

This project uses `@spike-rabbit/element-ng` (Siemens Element design system). Apply the following
conventions and best practices when reviewing code.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

## Angular Best Practices

- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the default.
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead

## Components

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Use signal queries (`viewChild()`, `viewChildren()`, `contentChild()`, `contentChildren()`) instead of decorator queries (`@ViewChild`, `@ViewChildren`, `@ContentChild`, `@ContentChildren`)
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator. Only flag this for **newly added** components in the PR. Do NOT flag existing components that are missing it — adding OnPush to existing components is out of scope for a PR review.
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead

## State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead
- Do NOT use `effect()` for propagation of state changes — this leads to `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked` errors, infinite circular updates, or unnecessary change detection cycles. Use `computed()` instead to model state that depends on other state

## Async Test Stabilization

- Prefer `await fixture.whenStable()` over repeated `fixture.detectChanges()` calls after interactions or async state changes
- `whenStable()` waits for pending microtasks, timers, and zone activity to settle, producing more reliable tests than manually pumping change detection
- Use `fixture.detectChanges()` deliberately for the initial render or when the change detection boundary itself is under test
- Do NOT chain multiple `detectChanges()` calls hoping to flush async work — use `whenStable()` instead

## Test Assertions

- Prefer Vitest's semantic assertion matchers over generic `.toBe()` with manual property access — they produce clearer failure messages and more readable tests
- Use `toHaveLength(n)` instead of accessing `.length` manually: `expect(items).toHaveLength(3)` not `expect(items.length).toBe(3)`
- Use `toContain(item)` instead of `expect(array.includes(item)).toBe(true)`
- Use `toMatchObject(subset)` to assert on a subset of properties instead of multiple individual `.toBe()` assertions

## Templates

- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables

## Services

- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection

## UX Writing Guidelines

Review all user-facing text (labels, buttons, messages, tooltips, titles, empty states, dialogs) against
these Siemens UX writing guidelines.

### Style and Tone

- Use as few words as possible
- Use simple, specific, clear, and informative wording
- Use the same words and grammatical forms, lengths, and styles repeatedly
- Use natural, conversational language — not robotic, funny, cool, or clever
- Avoid talking to the user directly on the UI
- Address users in second-person (you) and first-person plural for the application (we) only in formal contexts (emails, app tour)
- Use gender-neutral language (their, them, theirs, salesperson — not his, hers, him, salesman)
- Avoid 'please', 'sorry' and other forms of apology
- Use positive instead of negative framing
- Avoid using contractions (use "cannot" not "can't", "will not" not "won't")

### Length

- Use sentences only when necessary
- Use short words (3–5 letters) instead of long words (8+)
- Keep sentences under 25 words (average 15)
- Keep titles under 65 characters (including spaces)

### Capitalization

- Capitalize only the first letter of the first word in titles, tooltips, menu items, list items, and buttons
- Do not use all-caps (e.g., `PLANNING` → `Planning`)
- Capitalize proper nouns (places, organizations, products, tools, languages)
- Preserve the original casing of library, package, and product names as they should follow the official capitalization as shown on their websites or GitHub repos, even in titles, headings, and list items (e.g., `ngx-datatable` stays lowercase, not `Ngx-datatable`; `AG Grid` stays as-is)
- Capitalize named app functions and UI elements: "Go to Settings", "Press OK"

### Grammar

- Use present simple tense for actions and instructions (click, browse, upload)
- Use present participle with ellipsis for ongoing progress (Uploading…)
- Use active voice ("Configuration file opens" not "The configuration file is opened")
- Use "click" not "press"; use "hover" not "mouse over"
- Avoid multi-word phrasal verbs when one word works ("remove" not "get rid of", "calculate" not "add up", "retrieve data" not "fetch data")

### Time-Based Vocabulary

- Use "latest" (most recent, more may follow) not "last" (implies nothing else will follow)
- Use "recent" for time-focused references
- Avoid "last", "latest", "recent" if the verb relates to a timestamp

### Punctuation

- Minimize punctuation — always consider whether it is necessary
- Exclamation marks for high-level warnings only
- Avoid question marks in modal titles
- Avoid colons whenever possible (e.g., "User name" not "User name:")
- Avoid full sentences on interactive UI pages — use telegram style without a trailing full stop
- Use ellipsis only for transitional text (e.g., "Uploading…")
- No space before %, colon, semi-colon, or ellipsis
- Add a space before units of measurement (e.g., "30 mm")

### Abbreviations and Acronyms

- Avoid abbreviations (info, incl, excl) and acronyms
- Explain acronyms initially and in full unless well known: "Asset Performance Suite (APS)"
- No periods in abbreviations or acronyms
- Never make up your own acronyms

### Common UX Wording Mistakes

- "time zone" not "timezone"
- "log file" not "logfile"
- "log in" as a verb, "login" as a noun
- "equipment" not "equipments"; "feedback" not "feedbacks"; "training" not "trainings"
- "current" not "actual" (avoid misunderstandings with electricity)
- Avoid "shall" — use "can", "must", or "should"

### Inappropriate and Forbidden Terms

- Use "Manager", "Lead", "Primary" — not "Master"
- Use "Subordinate", "Secondary" — not "Slave"
- Use "Block-list" not "Blacklist"; "Allow-list" not "Whitelist"
- Use "Cancel", "Stop", "End" — not "Abort"
- Use "Disrupt", "Remove" — not "Kill"
- Use "End", "Stop", "Finish" — not "Terminate"
- Use "Run", "Perform", "Carry out" — not "Execute"

### Error Messages

- Three parts: 1. title 2. explanation 3. action
- Avoid using the word "error" or "warning" — these are superfluous when design elements (icons, color) convey severity
- Do not blame the user
- Avoid "Try again" and "Contact administrator" unless there is a good chance it will help
- Avoid "success", "successful", "successfully" — they are superfluous
- Avoid "information" as a title

### Dialogs and Buttons

- Use concise, descriptive dialog titles (e.g., "Add user", "Delete file")
- Button labels should describe the action and relate to the dialog title (Cancel, Add / Cancel, Delete)
- Avoid "Yes" and "No" as buttons — use clear action verbs
- Only use "OK" if no appropriate verb exists
- Primary button on the right, secondary on the left (Cancel, Save — not Save, Cancel)
- In confirmation dialogs, formulate a question aimed at the primary action

### Empty States

- Use three parts: 1. title 2. explanation 3. action
- Tell the user the empty space is intentional (not an error)
- Use wording to move the user forward and help them resolve the empty state

### Transitional Text

- Use -ing verbs and ellipsis (e.g., "Updating user roles…")
- Confirmation messages should use the same verb (e.g., "Saving project…" → "Project saved")
- Do not use informal transitional wording (e.g., avoid "Getting ready…")

### Common Actions Terminology

- "Create" + "Delete" go together (usually permanent, cannot be restored)
- "Add" + "Remove" go together (usually reversible, can be restored)
- Do not mix Delete and Remove as synonyms

## Contribution Guidelines

PRs must follow the project's contribution guidelines documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Commit Message Format

Commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) based on the
Angular convention.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

#### Allowed Types

- **feat**: A new feature (appears in changelog)
- **fix**: A bug fix (appears in changelog)
- **fixup**: Fix of an unreleased feature (not in changelog)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Formatting changes (white-space, semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvement (appears in changelog)
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests
- **build**: Build system or dependency changes
- **ci**: CI configuration changes
- **chore**: Other changes not modifying src or test files
- **revert**: Reverting a previous commit

#### Scope Rules

- Set scope to the entry point/folder name of the component or service (e.g., `button`, `tree-view`)
- Use `/` separator for sub-components (e.g., `charts/sankey`)
- For cross-component changes, use common scopes: `angular`, `api`, `a11y`, `ionic`, `i18n`, `theme`, `webcomponents`
- Scope is mandatory for changelog-included types (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`)

#### Subject Rules

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Do not capitalize the first letter
- No dot (`.`) at the end
- Write from the user's perspective for `feat`, `fix`, `perf` types

#### Breaking Changes and Deprecations

- Breaking changes must include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer with summary, description, and migration instructions
- Deprecations must include `DEPRECATED:` in the footer with description and recommended update path
- Always use a scope in the header when including breaking change or deprecation notes
- Issue references must be placed before any breaking change or deprecation notes

### Test Coverage

- PRs that introduce functional changes (new features, bug fixes, refactors affecting behavior) must include corresponding unit tests
- New components, services, directives, and pipes must have accompanying test files
- Bug fixes should include a test that reproduces the fixed bug to prevent regressions
- Modified logic paths must be covered by updated or new test cases
- PRs containing only documentation, style, CI, or build changes are exempt from this requirement
