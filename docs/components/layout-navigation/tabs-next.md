# TabsNext

Starting with Element v48, we are introducing `si-tab-next` as an experimental 
component that will eventually replace the current `si-tab` component. This new
implementation brings significant improvements in responsive behavior, ensuring
better adaptation across different screen sizes and devices. The component has been
rebuilt with a strong focus on accessibility standards, including enhanced ARIA
compliance and improved keyboard navigation.

## Code ---

### Usage

```ts
import { SiTabNextComponent, SiTabsetNextComponent } from '@spike-rabbit/element-ng/tabs-next';

  ]
})
```
